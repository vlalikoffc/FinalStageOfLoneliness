## 🚀 What FinalStageOfLoneliness Adds

FinalStageOfLoneliness introduces tactical AI behavior and role-based bot logic designed for solo players.  
Bots can act as defenders, builders, scouts, or fighters — coordinating as a team to support the player in survival scenarios.

This project is focused on emotional design and intelligent automation, built for those who play alone but never want to feel alone.
